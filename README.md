# Karrieretag_Projekt

The Karrieretag Plugin is a WordPress plugin that adds a custom menu page to the WordPress dashboard. This menu page allows users to select forms on the website and export their data as a CSV file.

## Instalation

- Download the plugin ZIP file from the GitHub repository.
- Login to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to Plugins > Add New.
- Click on the "Upload Plugin" button, then select the downloaded ZIP file and click "Install Now".
- After installation, activate the plugin.

## Usage

- Login to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to the "Karrieretag" menu page.
- Check the checkboxes next to the forms you want to export data from.
- Click the "Export" link next to the form name to download the CSV file containing the form data.

## Config

- Find the lines where the Database data is used.
- Change it to yours.
- Optional: you could implement global variables that can be used there.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience any issues with the plugin, please try the following:

- Make sure that your WordPress installation meets the plugin's requirements (WordPress 5.2 or later, PHP 7.0 or later).
- Check that the plugin is activated and that the custom menu page is accessible from the WordPress dashboard.
