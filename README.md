$content

The $content variable typically represents the content of a WordPress post or page. This can include text, images, videos, and other media that is included in the post or page content.

When you write a plugin or theme for WordPress, you may want to modify the post or page content before it is displayed on the website. To do this, you can use the the_content filter hook, which provides access to the $content variable.

Here's an example of how you might use the the_content filter hook to modify the post content:

function my_custom_content_filter( $content ) {
    // modify $content as desired
    return $content;
}
add_filter( 'the_content', 'my_custom_content_filter' );

In this example, the my_custom_content_filter() function will be executed whenever the the_content filter hook is run, and it will modify the post content before it is displayed on the website.

Note that $content can also be used in other filter and action hooks in WordPress, depending on the context. For example, it might represent the content of a comment or the body of an email message.
